      <p>
        <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> is a 1975 musical science-fiction
        horror-comedy film. Though the initial reaction was negative, it soon
        became a cult sensation. To this day, it's often shown at midnight with
        "shadow casts" who mime and lip-sync what happens on the screen.
        Audiences are invited to shout callbacks, dance, dress up, throw various
        props (from pre-approved prop bags), and even join us in an underwear
        run!

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Unlike in most movie theaters, we encourage you to yell things out
          during the show! Most callbacks are jokes timed with something
          happened on the screen. There are many types of callbacks; some are
          call and response, some require multiple people, some are chants, some
          have been around for ages, and some change every night!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an easy callback to remember: when you hear the name "Brad
          Majors", call him an asshole!

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          You can wear whatever you're comfortable with! Er, as long as it
          doesn't violate any laws (no nudity). Oftentimes people come dressed
          in costumes from or inspired by the movie, and we see a lot of
          fishnets, high heels, corsets, etc., you get the picture. We do
          encourage you to wear nice underwear (see underwear run, below). Oh,
          and we should probably mention, some people may get a little wet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocky Horror is a great place to express yourself. No matter what you
          wear, whether you dress up or don't, you'll fit right in here.

        <h2>What props can I throw?</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Please, do not bring outside prop bags! The Sonic Transducers will
          have prop bags for sale prior to the show that contain theatre
          approved props. Please refrain from throwing anything else. This
          includes, but is not limited to: rice, confetti, hot dogs, bread,
          popcorn, concession stand food, and water.

        <h2>What's an "underwear run"?</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The underwear run is one of our favorite traditions! About midway
          through the movie, after everyone sits down for dinner (meatloaf,
          anyone?), Frank slaps Janet in the face, and she takes off running.
          She'll run right off stage and out the theater door, and you're
          invited to follow!
        </p>

        <p>
          You're encouraged to strip down to your undies (but keep those naughty
          bits covered). If you're not comfortable in just your skivvies, no
          worries, we welcome various levels of undress!

          Virgin alert! In the Rocky Horror world, a "virgin" is someone who has
          never experienced <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> in a theater
          with an audience and a live cast. Seeing it at home (DVD, streaming
          services, TV, etc.) doesn't count!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're a virgin, you may be invited to play some of our special
          virgin games before the show. It's traditional to get marked with a
          "V" on your forehead in red lipstick. Don't worry about being
          unprepared, just be ready to have fun! Just like in sex, virgins
          aren't expected to know anything!
